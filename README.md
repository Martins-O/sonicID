## 🚀 What is SonicID?

SonicID revolutionizes digital identity verification by leveraging Sonic's 400,000 TPS blockchain and zero-knowledge proofs to provide **instant (< 3 seconds)** identity verification without compromising user privacy. Unlike traditional KYC that takes 24-72 hours and stores personal data, SonicID enables immediate verification while keeping sensitive information completely private.

### Key Innovation
- **10,000x faster** than traditional KYC
- **Zero personal data storage** using ZK proofs
- **Cross-platform reputation** that follows users everywhere
- **Real-time fraud detection** with advanced risk scoring
- **One-time setup** for lifetime identity portability
